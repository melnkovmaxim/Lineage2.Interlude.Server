According to a custom from the Elmoreden period, a Silver Spear was the symbol of the family responsible for guarding
the royal family.<br>

An ancient proverb says, <font color="LEVEL">"A jeweled scepter for the mighty King of Elmore and two Silver Spears for
his protectors"</font>.<br>

I'll wager that somewhere is a lock that matches this key...
