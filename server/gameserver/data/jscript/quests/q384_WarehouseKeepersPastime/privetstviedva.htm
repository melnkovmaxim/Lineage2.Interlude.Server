We bet items! Working as a warehouse keeper, all sorts of items become available to you.
Many items in the warehouse go unclaimed, therefore I never lack for things to wager.

<font color="LEVEL">Lately, I've been betting Warehouse Keeper's Medals.</font><br>
These are awards issued by the Iron Gate Guild to warehouse keepers according to their productivity. Please don't tell anyone I'm wagering with them!
<br><br>
I've actually had a problem with this lately...
