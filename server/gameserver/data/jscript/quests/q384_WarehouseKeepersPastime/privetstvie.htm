Being a warehouse keeper can be very strong, just sitting around waiting for people to bring items in. 
<font color="LEVEL">Warehouse keepers think of different ways to amuse themselves.</font> 
I usually pass the time playing <font color="LEVEL">bingo></font> with other warehouse keepers. 
On my day off, I visit the warehouse keepers in the village and play bingo with them.
<br><br>
But we find the old rules of the game too boring...
