I arranged the numbers 1 through 9 on the panel. Don't peek!
<br><br>
I've learned the hard way that i must get your payment in advance. Some players run away when they realizw that they don't have a chance of winning the game. If you quit during game play, you will forfeit your wager. Is this agreeable?
<br><br>
Now select 6 numbers between 1 and 9. Pick you first number.
