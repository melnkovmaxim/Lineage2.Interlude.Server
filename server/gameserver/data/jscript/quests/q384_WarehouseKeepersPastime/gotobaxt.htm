Good choice! After you bring the <font color="LEVEL">Warehouse Keeper's Medals</font> to me, I'll let you <font color="LEVEL">play bingo</font>.
If you win, I'll give you an unclaimed item as a reward!You never know... you may obtain a high quality weapon or armor!
<br><br>
According to our rules, <font color="LEVEL">you can bet either 10 or 100 medals</font>.
Therefore, you should bring back at least 10 medals.
Of course, if you bet 100 medals, you'll have a better chance of winning a higher-quality item.
<br><br>
Ah, Go and see <font color="LEVEL">Warehouse Chief Baxt of Hunters Village</font>, he will also let you play bingo. 
He feels responsible for allowing the robbery to happen, and has offered to help with the recovery of the medals.
<br><br>
There is one more important thing. Based upon the footprints, hair samples and statements from witnesses, the evil creatures that attacked the cargo wagon were rot ting. Good luck!
