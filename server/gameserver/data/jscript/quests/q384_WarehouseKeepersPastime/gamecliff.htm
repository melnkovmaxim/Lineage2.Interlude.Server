Did you bring the Medals? Then let's play Bingo!
<br><br>
According to the rules followed by us Warehouse Keepers, bets may only be placed in amounts of 10 or 100 Medals.
Of course, bets of 100 Medals give you a better chance of obtaining a high-quality item.
<br><br>
<font color="LEVEL">
By the way, before you start playing, make sure that you
I have enough room in your inventory. 
It would be a shame if you won and couldn't carry your prize away, wouldn't it?</font>
