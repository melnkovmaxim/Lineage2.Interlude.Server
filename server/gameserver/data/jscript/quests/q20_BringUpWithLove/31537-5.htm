Please bring me a <font color="LEVEL">Jewel of Innocence</font>. This isn't something you can purchase, or kill something for... You must earn it by raising a beast yourself!
<br>
Alas, the is an honor that only comes once in a lifetime... I'll never forget my little beast... And the brilliance of that gemstone!
<br>
If only I could possess one again... Could you please bring a <font color="LEVEL">Jewel of Innocence</font> to me?
