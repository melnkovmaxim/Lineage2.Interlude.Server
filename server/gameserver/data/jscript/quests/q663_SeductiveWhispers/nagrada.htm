If you win the game, the master running it owes you the appropriate amount.
The higher the round, the bigger the payout.
That's why the game only allows you to win up to 8 rounds in a row,
If -- and that's a big if -- you manage to win 8 straight times, the game will end.
<br><br>
Keep in mind that <font color="LEVEL">if you lose any of the rounds, you get nothing.</font>
That's fair warningm my friend. Here's how the priza system works:
<br><br>
1 winning round: 40,000 Adena
<br><br>
2 winning round: 80,000 Adena
<br><br>
3 winning round: 100,000 Adena, D-grade Enchant Weapon Scroll 
<br><br>
4 winning round: 199,000 Adena, C-grade Enchant Weapon Scroll
<br><br>
5 winning round: 388,000 Adena, 1 recipe for a B-grade Weapon
<br><br>
6 winning round: 675,000 Adena, 1 essential ingridient for a B-grade Weapon
<br><br>
7 winning round: 1,284,000 Adena, 2 B-grade Enchant Weapon Scrolls, 2 B-grade Enchant Armor Scrolls
<br><br>
8 winning round: 2,384,000 Adena, 1 A-grade Enchant Weapon Scroll, 2 A-grade Enchant Armor Scrolls
<br><br>
My advice is to identify what you'd like to win and then to play for the prize. Any questions?
