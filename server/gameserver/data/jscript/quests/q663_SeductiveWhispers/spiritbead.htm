When a being's thought or spirit energy comes together into the shape of a bead, we call that a Spirit Bead.
Artisans like me need them to make good weapons. That's any we gamble with them -- as they worth a lot to us.
In this area, they say you can easily get Spirit Beads if you go to <font color="LEVEL">Aden Cemetery, The Ancientbattleground and the Fields of Massacre</font>
<br><br>
First, at <font color="LEVEL">The Cemetery</font>, you can obtain <font color="LEVEL">Spirit Beads</font> from the undead creatures known as the
<font color="LEVEL">Spiteful Ghost of Ruin, Soldier of Grief, Cruel Punisher, Roving Soul, Tortured Undead and Wasted Soul.</font> 
<br><br>
Second, at <font color="LEVEL">the Ancient Battlegrounds</font>, you can obtain <font color="LEVEL">Spirit Beads</font> from the undead known as
<font color="LEVEL">Past Knight, Ghostly Warrior, Hungered Corps, the Dark Guard, Death Agent and Nihil Invandr</font>
and from the demons known as <font color="LEVEL">Bloody Lord, Bloody Priest, Blody Knight and Bloody Ghost.</font>
<br><br>
Lastly, at the <font color="LEVEL">Fields of Massacre</font>, <font color="LEVEL">Spirit Beads</font> from undead known as
<font color="LEVEL">Doom Scout, Doom Servant, Doom Guard, Doom Archer, Doom Trooper, Doom Warrior, Doom Knight, Wretched Archer, Spiteful Soul Leader, Spiteful Soul Wizard and Spiteful Soul Fighter.</font>
