<br>
Where are the other pieces? <br>
I distinctly remember asking you to bring me 10 pieces of White Fabric soaked in blood... <br>
You haven't thrown them away or given them to someoneelse, have you? <br>
Oh, well, nothing can be done about it now. Since you've done the work, <br>
I'll pay you, but I must say that I'm very disappointed... <br>
I thought you were trustworthy! Oh, well, live and learm. Goodbye.<br>
