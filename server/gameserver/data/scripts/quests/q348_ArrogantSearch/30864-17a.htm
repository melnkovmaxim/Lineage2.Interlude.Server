<br>
You are back again...but you are not done with the last task I asked of you. Listen carefully: <br>
You need to dip the cloth in the blood of a <font color=LEVEL>Platinum Tribe Overlord</font> or a <font color=LEVEL>Platinum Tribe Shaman</font>. <br>
Once you have made the cloth completely red from their blood, come back to me and I promise to tell you a secret.<br>
