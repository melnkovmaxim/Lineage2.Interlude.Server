Good job! You killed all the guardians and recovered the relics!
Actually, before i tell you how to disguise yourself so that you can visit the Emperor, I've got a question for you. You seem like an ambitious sort... Rather than going to meet with the old Emperor, would you rather make some money?
"No, I want to meet the Emperor."
"I want to make some money."
